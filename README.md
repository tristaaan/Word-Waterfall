#Word Waterfall
Create word waterfalls. Kinda like word clouds but with more quantification to the visualization. Currently exports as SVG or plaintext.

A folder of sample SVG output created from several works found on Wikisource can be found [here](http://cs.earlham.edu/~twright09/viz-one-revised/).

###About
Originally written for a basic software engineering class, modified to support visualizations for a data visualization class.
